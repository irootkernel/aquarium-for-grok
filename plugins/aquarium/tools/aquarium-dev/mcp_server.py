INSTRUCTIONS = """Manage the Aquarium development channel only on an explicit user request.
Diagnose the named canonical checkout before effects. Report dirty state, exact SHA,
enrollment and hook ownership. Enrollment, hook changes, builds, and service activation
retain independent user approvals; an approval boolean records consent, it does not grant it.
Show the full service plan and obtain consent to its exact token before service_apply.
Never infer approval from tool availability, a successful build, or a previous token.
Use /aquarium:dev-setup-global for a missing or outdated manager runtime. No tool installs
production tools, configures Grok, authenticates, commits, or changes producer-owned services
except through their native controller. After each effect, diagnose again. If a call is
interrupted, inspect state before retrying: lack of a response does not establish failure.
