# Development Tool Catalog

This catalog is shared by `dev-setup-global` and `dev-setup`. The global skill owns user-global installation, upgrades, paired skills, services, and global MCP state. The repository skill owns only repository configuration and readiness. Read only the sections needed for the selected components.

Use only the section for a selected tool. Repository instructions override this catalog.

## Aquarium Development Manager

Source: the exact installed Aquarium plugin, under `tools/aquarium-dev/`. This optional local tool uses Aquarium's release version and has hash-pinned MCP Python SDK dependencies. It has no paired skill. Its MCP registration comes from the plugin; do not add a duplicate global registration.

Run `inspect_global_tools.py --component aquarium-dev` to compare the installed runtime with the bundled source and check its launcher without changing either. This component requires Apple Silicon macOS and Python 3.11 or newer. It is not a production-binary prerequisite.

For a scoped install or update request, resolve the current skill's plugin root, inspect its payload, and show the exact bundled version, source digest, manager root, launcher target, and existing state. After runtime and launcher approval, run:

```text
python3 <plugin-root>/tools/aquarium-dev/install.py install --approve-install --approve-launcher
```

The same command installs or updates. It creates an isolated Python environment under `~/.aquarium-dev/manager/versions/` and installs exact, hash-verified wheels from `https://pypi.org/simple` and its `files.pythonhosted.org` download host. Disclose that network access before execution. It validates the package and SDK before switching `manager/current`, installs the regular-file `~/.local/bin/aquarium-dev` entry, and preserves the prior runtime and launcher if preparation or selection fails. Prior runtime generations remain available to admitted workers and open MCP sessions. No source is uploaded.

Re-run diagnosis and `~/.local/bin/aquarium-dev version`. Start a new Grok session for the plugin's MCP server. A plugin update does not update the runtime automatically; an identity mismatch requires this explicit update before the bundled MCP server can start. The existing CLI remains on its installed version. The installer does not change Git hooks, enroll checkouts, build producers, activate services, configure Grok, or change authentication. Legacy hook migration is a later, separately approved `aquarium-dev enroll` operation described in the [development contract](development-contract.md).

## Shared version and safety policy

- Resolve the latest non-draft, non-prerelease stable release at execution time from the official repository, limited to a tool's supported release line when its section defines one. Display the exact tag and source before installation; never substitute `@latest` after approval.
- Preserve an already compatible installation unless the user approves an upgrade.
- Diagnose credentials by whether the owning CLI reports readiness. Never print, copy, or persist credential material.
- Keep configuration in each tool's native files. Never create `.aquarium`, a selection manifest, or a shadow version registry.
- A direct unscoped `/aquarium:dev-setup-global` invocation authorizes bounded official Release metadata lookup for every supported global component. A scoped continuation authorizes the same lookup only for its named components. Dolgorae, Sanho, Mulgae, Gaori, Sorage, and Podway also allow one disclosed bounded freshness comparison against the paired-skill files from the documented `raw.githubusercontent.com` path in ephemeral storage. Sorage has one file; Dolgorae, Sanho, Mulgae, and Podway each have four. Gaori has four files for `use-gaori` and one for `use-gaori-status`. No separate approval is required for those exact lookups. Treat archive downloads, init, Project registration, ignore edits, hook edits, global installs, provider contact, and every network operation outside these exceptions as separately approved effects.
- Apply the backup policy selected under `Choose a Backup Policy for Existing State` to every approved action that overwrites or removes an existing binary, skill, configuration, service, managed Procedure, or runtime state.

A backup choice requires exact backup and restoration commands plus verification before mutation. A no-backup choice requires the exact loss and recovery boundary in the proposal but no retained copy of the replaced state. It never waives source, checksum, frontmatter, diff, target, or post-install verification, and incoming payload staging is not a backup.

## Choose a Backup Policy for Existing State

When an approved setup plan will first overwrite or remove existing tool, skill, configuration, service, managed Procedure, or runtime state, establish one backup policy for the current setup request. If the user already explicitly requested backups or no backups, adopt that choice without asking again. Otherwise offer `Create and verify backups` and `Proceed without backups`, recommending the backup choice. Do not ask about backups for diagnosis or a new installation that replaces nothing.

Keep the selected policy for later overwrite and removal proposals in the same setup request unless the user changes it. The policy does not authorize any mutation: show and approve every exact replacement or removal. One Ouroboros proposal may cover the listed CLI, home integration, MCP, and migration actions; do not request approval again for an action already covered. Never persist the choice in repository or user-global configuration.

For the backup policy, show the exact backup path, commands, verification, and restoration procedure before approval, and stop before mutation if the selected backup cannot be verified. For the no-backup policy, state the exact existing paths or state that will be lost and the available recovery boundary.

A published Git ref may allow a distributed skill or binary to be installed again, but it does not recover local modifications. Treat tracked state as recoverable only when it already exists in Git history, and disclose that private configuration, untracked files, and runtime history may be permanently lost.

Preparing and validating an incoming payload in a temporary location is not a backup and remains required.

## Sanho

Official source: `https://github.com/irootkernel/sanho`

Supported release line: stable `v0.2.7` through `v0.2.x`. Resolve the newest non-draft, non-prerelease tag in that range. Use the same exact tag for the CLI and its optional `use-sanho` skill; v0.2.6 does not provide the required push-preview, canonical-history, commit-inspection, or normalized JSON argument-error surfaces, and do not automatically cross into `v0.3+`.

Install an approved tag:

```bash
go install github.com/irootkernel/sanho/cmd/sanho@<tag>
```

The binary does not install the agent skill. Diagnose the CLI and workspace with `command -v sanho`, `sanho version --json`, `sanho status --json`, and `sanho doctor --json`; diagnose `use-sanho` independently in the agent skill roots. Read JSON rather than inferring state from human tables or exit status alone. Doctor exits 0 when it reports warnings, so treat a positive `warnings` count as degraded even when the process succeeds. Every malformed `--json` invocation must return the stable `invalid_arguments` error envelope; parse that envelope separately from the process exit and never reinterpret it as workspace state.

For a new user-scoped skill installation, use only these files from the automatically fetched and verified `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irootkernel/sanho/<tag>/skills/use-sanho/` payload: `SKILL.md`, `references/lifecycle.md`, `references/authoring.md`, and `references/recovery.md`. Verify the complete file set, SHA-256 digests, and `name: use-sanho` frontmatter before atomically moving it to `~/.agents/skills/use-sanho`. Repeat every raw GitHub endpoint and the user-global target in the installation proposal even though the comparison fetch itself needs no separate approval.

If the target already exists, compare it with the verified source, show the complete diff, follow the shared backup policy, and obtain separate replacement approval. Under the no-backup policy, remove only the exact approved target after the incoming file set is fully verified; disclose that local modifications will not be recoverable from the release ref. Never overwrite, merge, delete, or repair another discovered copy silently. After installation or replacement, tell the user to restart Grok so a new session loads the skill snapshot.

`sanho status` separates committed `HEAD` prediction from working-copy and local operation readiness. Consume `relation`, `publication`, `sync_preview`, `working_copy`, `local_readiness`, and `sync_in_progress` independently. Do not expose project URLs, actor email, workspace IDs, private paths, or doctor details in setup reports.

Use `sanho check --require-clean`, `--require-current`, and `--require-published` only when repository authority selects those policies. Exit 1 with `passed:false` is a policy mismatch; an `error` envelope means evaluation failed. `--require-current` contacts the canonical remote and requires network approval. `sanho diff`, `sanho diff --refresh`, and `sanho diff --local` are read-only inspection commands without JSON output; `--refresh` contacts the canonical remote.

At an authorized push boundary, leave `sanho preview --json` to the matching `use-sanho` skill. Preview writes nothing and reports a blocked push at exit 0, so branch on `blocked` and `verdict`, not the exit code; add `--refresh` only with network authorization when the verdict must match the canonical state the hook will fetch. A preview describes one snapshot and never grants push authority, while `sanho check` remains the explicit policy gate.

Leave canonical history and rewrite-recovery inspection to the matching `use-sanho` skill through read-only `sanho log` and `sanho show <commit>`. Both default to the cached canonical snapshot and `--refresh` requires network authorization. Source filters must use exact non-empty repository or workspace values from observed provenance; an `external` entry has `source: null` and matches no source filter. Use `show` before adopting an external recovery anchor, preserve binary content as classified with null content, and treat `too_large` as a bounded refusal rather than loading the document another way.

Initialization always requires a user-confirmed project name. Inspect `sanho state --all --json` and normalize it without reporting private URLs or paths. A registered v2 project with a non-empty canonical URL may be reused without repeating the URL; an unregistered project still requires a user-confirmed documentation repository URL:

```bash
sanho init --project <project> --docs-repo-url <url>
sanho init --project <registered-project>
```

Before approval, disclose that init can create `.sanho.json` and `.sanho_base.json`, register a private clone, install managed Git hook lines, update ignore state, and conditionally stage documentation state. Inspect custom or Husky hooks and request any required management opt-in rather than forcing initialization. Never guess the project name or URL.

After initialization or upgrade, verify `sanho status --refresh --json`, `sanho doctor --json`, and `git status --short`. Do not run `sanho clean`, `sanho init --force`, `sanho sync --abort`, `sanho migrate`, or any sync/pull operation during setup.

For an explicitly requested repair, load and follow the installed `/use-sanho` lifecycle or recovery guidance when available. `sanho doctor --fix` requires its own repair approval and a fresh status and doctor check afterward. `sanho workspace forget <workspace-id>` requires selecting one exact row from `sanho state --all --json`, proving that its checkout path no longer exists, and separate removal approval. Do not map general setup, cancellation, or cleanup intent to either command.

## Dolgorae

This edition does not diagnose, install, or offer Dolgorae. Independent Review on this host dispatches Grok `spawn_subagent` reviewers. Do not add Dolgorae as a bundle component, a production-binary prerequisite, or a review backend.

## Mulgae

Official source: `https://github.com/irootkernel/mulgae`

Supported release line: stable `v0.1.19` through `v0.1.x`, native Apple Silicon macOS only. Resolve the newest non-draft, non-prerelease tag in that range. Use the same exact tag for the CLI and its optional `use-mulgae` skill; v0.1.18 lacks the current v6 command envelope and exact composite recovery contract required by Aquarium, and do not automatically cross into `v0.2+`. Installation requires Go `1.26.6` or newer.

Install an approved tag:

```bash
go install github.com/irootkernel/mulgae@<tag>
```

The binary does not install the agent skill. Default setup diagnosis uses only `command -v mulgae`, `mulgae version --json`, and `mulgae doctor --output json`, plus effective Grok MCP inspection when available. Require the `mulgae-command-result.v6` envelope and feature-detect `result.doctor.schema_version=mulgae-doctor-result.v2`. If Doctor v2 is absent, report the capability as unsupported; never fabricate failed dimensions or reconstruct them from `.mulgae/config.yaml` or `.mulgae/local.yaml`.

Project Doctor v2 reports `config_v3`, `local_configuration`, `provider_identity`, `configured_readiness`, and `role_route_readiness` independently. Preserve its `verified`, `failed`, `unverifiable`, and `not_applicable` states and each configured `provider_inventory[]` row's `binary_available` and `cli_compatible` fields. Use `cli_compatible.eligibility` as Mulgae's provider-version decision; `newer_than_verified` remains ready when eligibility is `eligible`. Treat setup as configured only when `configured_readiness.state=ready` and `exit_code=0`. Do not gate or report setup on static evidence, heartbeat, historical reviews, or `review_qualified`, and never report native homes, executable paths, credential-profile homes, credentials, diagnostic messages, request IDs, timestamps, or raw provider output.

Setup does not need `mulgae providers --output json`. If that command is explicitly inspected outside the default setup flow, keep `offline_ready_provider_count` and `static_evidence_ready_provider_count` distinct; missing static evidence is not a generic unavailable provider.

For a new user-scoped skill installation, use only these files from the automatically fetched and verified `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irootkernel/mulgae/<tag>/skills/use-mulgae/` payload: `SKILL.md`, `references/lifecycle.md`, `references/authoring.md`, and `references/recovery.md`. Verify the complete file set, SHA-256 digests, and `name: use-mulgae` frontmatter before atomically moving it to `~/.agents/skills/use-mulgae`. Repeat every raw GitHub endpoint and the user-global target in the installation proposal even though the comparison fetch itself needs no separate approval.

If the target already exists, compare it with the verified source, show the complete diff, follow the shared backup policy, and obtain separate replacement approval. Under the no-backup policy, remove only the exact approved target after the incoming file set is fully verified; disclose that local modifications will not be recoverable from the release ref. Never overwrite, merge, delete, or repair another discovered copy silently. After installation or replacement, tell the user to restart Grok so a new session loads the skill snapshot.

Mulgae Config v3 has two authorities. `.mulgae/config.yaml` is Git-shareable project policy; `.mulgae/local.yaml` is untracked mode-`0600` machine configuration. Keep `execution.workspace_access: none`. Ask which providers and roles to configure. Automatic provider selection still requires authenticated ZCode and AGY; Kimi and Codex are explicit opt-ins, and bare initialization enables only the required `logic` role. Show discovered executable, launcher, data-home, and credential-home paths only in the exact private setup proposal, never in the diagnostic report.

For a new project, run `mulgae init --output json` with every intended provider and role only after approval; it creates both Config v3 files, writes `validation.extraction.enabled: true` for prose-first structured finding extraction, and does not edit Git ignore state. When a clone contains only shared `config.yaml`, plain `mulgae init --output json` bootstraps only `local.yaml` and rejects project-policy options.

An older Config v3 that omits `validation.extraction.enabled` remains valid and treats extraction as disabled/defaulted. Do not add the field during diagnosis, clone bootstrap, refresh, or an unrelated repair. Enabling it in an existing project changes shared project policy and requires an exact diff plus separate approval. Once the field is written, every collaborator and automation reading the config must use Mulgae v0.1.16 or newer because v0.1.15 rejects the unknown field; never claim backward compatibility or silently remove the policy.

When provider paths move or the shared provider set changes, propose `mulgae init --refresh-local --output json`, which preserves `config.yaml` and replaces only `local.yaml`; apply the shared backup policy to the replaced local file. Keep new initialization, clone bootstrap, and refresh as distinct approvals.

Config v1 and v2 are unsupported and have no automatic migration. Show the exact legacy files without reading or printing their contents and apply the shared backup policy before removal.

Under the backup policy, separately propose a user-chosen mode-`0700` backup directory outside the repository, preserve both files and their modes with `cp -p`, privately verify file names, modes, and SHA-256 digests, and disclose the exact `cp -p` restoration commands.

Under the no-backup policy, disclose that legacy project policy, private paths, modes, and other local-only values will not be recoverable unless the user independently versioned them. Obtain separate approval for the exact destructive legacy-file removal under either policy.

If Config v3 initialization fails, preserve the failure and do not partially edit either authority. Offer the disclosed restoration only when a verified backup exists; otherwise report that no rollback copy is available. Never reinterpret legacy provider policy or private paths automatically.

When the user selects Codex, require a real Codex CLI `0.149.0` or newer and let Mulgae diagnose its authenticated readiness; never sign in, read `auth.json`, or accept an API-key environment variable on the user's behalf. A single-profile configuration uses the selected native Codex login with `mulgae init --providers codex --roles <roles> --output json`. Optional model and reasoning-effort values are shared project policy; omission preserves Codex CLI defaults.

For several Codex identities, keep the two authorities separate using this Config v3 shape; it is sufficient for the active setup session even when a newly replaced `/use-mulgae` skill will not load until Grok restarts:

```yaml
# .mulgae/config.yaml project policy (relevant fields)
providers:
  codex:
    default_credential_profile: "personal"
roles:
  logic: {enabled: true, primary_provider: "codex"}
  security: {enabled: true, primary_provider: "codex", credential_profile: "work"}
```

```yaml
# .mulgae/local.yaml private machine mapping (relevant fields)
providers:
  codex:
    executable: "/absolute/path/to/the/common/codex"
    credential_homes:
      - profile: "personal"
        home: "/absolute/private/CODEX_HOME"
      - profile: "work"
        home: "/absolute/private/work-CODEX_HOME"
```

Use operator-chosen lowercase kebab-case aliases, map exactly the default and role override aliases in lexical order, and use one common real Codex executable. Obtain separate approval for the shared policy and private local mapping, show the exact proposed YAML privately, and preserve unrelated Config v3 fields. Mulgae may project only the selected home's `auth.json` into a disposable runtime; do not expose profile paths or credential material. After writing, require Doctor v2 to verify provider identity, report the intended role-to-profile aliases through redacted role references, and mark Codex binary and CLI compatibility ready without returning any home or executable path.

Review execution, extraction, and recovery belong to the paired `/use-mulgae` skill. [mulgae-review-contract.md](mulgae-review-contract.md) defines how Aquarium consumes published reports and structured findings; setup does not run or inspect extraction artifacts.

Setup verification remains limited to version, Doctor v2, and effective MCP registration. The command envelope is `mulgae-command-result.v6`, Doctor remains `mulgae-doctor-result.v2`, and preflight remains `mulgae-review-preflight.v3`; do not infer new setup probes from extraction or lifecycle support. Doctor's adapter-owned local version command is offline: it uses no credential projection, project working directory, provider API, or network request. Do not inspect config contents or runs, and do not invoke heartbeat, qualification, preflight, review, source transmission, or MCP startup to validate setup.

Heartbeat is outside setup. Only after a separate explicit user request acknowledging possible authentication, network access, cost, and remote logging may an agent propose `mulgae heartbeat --provider <family> --authorize-live-request --output json`, adding `--credential-profile <profile>` only for an explicitly selected named Grok configuration. Never add `--authorize-live-request` automatically. Require `mulgae-provider-heartbeat-result.v1` and preserve its typed `succeeded`, `provider_failure`, `timeout`, `authentication_failure`, `malformed_response`, or `execution_failure` status without retry. Do not promote success into offline readiness or review qualification. Without authorization, preserve Mulgae's `attempted=false` and `live_authorization_required` result.

Propose these root-anchored Git ignore rules through an exact reviewed diff:

```gitignore
/.mulgae/*
!/.mulgae/config.yaml
```

Verify that only `.mulgae/config.yaml` is trackable and that `.mulgae/local.yaml` and all runtime state remain untracked and ignored. Propose `.mulgaeignore` entries from the repository's secrets, generated output, large artifacts, agent instructions, and non-reviewable paths. A `.mulgaeignore` intended as shared capture policy may be tracked only with explicit approval.

Treat MCP as an optional, separately approved component and prefer one user-global registration in the user Grok config (`$GROK_HOME/config.toml`, default `~/.grok/config.toml`). A global registration inherits the active Grok session's working directory, so do not pin a repository path or `cwd`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.mulgae]
command = "<absolute-selected-mulgae-path>"
args = ["mcp"]
required = true
startup_timeout_sec = 30
tool_timeout_sec = 7501
```

When the user explicitly chooses repository-local scope, merge this machine-specific alternative into `<absolute-git-root>/.grok/config.toml` while preserving unrelated configuration:

```toml
[mcp_servers.mulgae]
command = "<absolute-selected-mulgae-path>"
args = ["mcp", "--project-root", "<absolute-git-root>"]
cwd = "<absolute-git-root>"
required = true
startup_timeout_sec = 30
tool_timeout_sec = 7501
```

Show the complete diff and target scope before approval; for a local target also show whether `.grok/config.toml` is tracked. Verify three views independently without starting the server: read the user-global `[mcp_servers.mulgae]` table from `~/.grok/config.toml` (or `$GROK_HOME/config.toml`), the local table from `<absolute-git-root>/.grok/config.toml`, and report the effective registration as the local entry when one exists and the user-global entry otherwise. Honour user-scoped `disabled_mcp_servers` as `registration_disabled` even when a project table still exists. This inspector does not read `grok mcp disable` compat sources (`.mcp.json`, Claude, Cursor), `managed_config.toml`, or `requirements.toml`. It reads `command` and `args` before Grok expands `${VAR}`.

The effective entry must be enabled STDIO, resolve to the selected binary, be required, and use startup and tool timeouts at least as large as the proposed defaults. Global scope requires exact `args = ["mcp"]` and no fixed `cwd`; local scope requires exact `mcp --project-root <canonical-root>` arguments and repository-bound `cwd`. The 7501-second tool timeout covers the admitted two-hour review deadline plus retry and finalization margin; preserve any larger existing value. An observable `required: true` is verified, observable `false` is a registration mismatch, and an absent field is `required_unverifiable`.

Whenever an isolated local Mulgae registration exists, ask whether that scope is intentional. If confirmed, preserve it even when global is preferred. If not, show and separately approve removal of only the local `mulgae` table through an exact TOML edit. Reinspect the file afterward. Delete `.grok/config.toml` only when parsed TOML has no remaining semantic content, and delete `.grok/` only when the directory is then empty; preserve comments with retained settings, every unrelated table, and every nonempty directory. Apply the shared backup policy before removal, never remove the global registration as part of local cleanup, and never stage the file during setup. Repository configuration paths must be regular non-symlink paths before `mulgae doctor` may read them.

Never stage it during setup. Tell the user to restart Grok after registration changes. Registration does not prove that the current session exposes the selected release's tools, including `compose_review`. Use already-exposed tool metadata when available without starting another server. The paired `/use-mulgae` skill owns asynchronous execution and native fallback; Aquarium consumes results through [mulgae-review-contract.md](mulgae-review-contract.md).

Verify configuration, provider readiness, skill files, and MCP registration only. Do not start the MCP server or run heartbeat, review, qualification, preflight, follow-up, delta, rerun, compose, report, export, or any command that captures, transmits, or writes review source or artifacts during setup. Mulgae owns its same-provider retry. Setup never starts recovery work; authorized review recovery follows [mulgae-review-contract.md](mulgae-review-contract.md) and the paired skill.

## Gaori

Official source: `https://github.com/irootkernel/gaori`

Supported release line: stable `v0.1.16` through `v0.1.x`. Resolve the newest non-draft, non-prerelease tag in that range. Use the same exact tag for the CLI and its optional `use-gaori` and `use-gaori-status` skills. Do not automatically cross into `v0.2+`. CLI JSON reports a `v`-prefixed version and a `commit` field; accept one optional leading `v` when comparing versions and tolerate the additional commit identity. MCP `serverInfo.version` uses the internal version representation. Verify each transport independently: a CLI on PATH does not prove the attached server version, and a missing CLI does not disable connected MCP execution. If host initialization metadata is unavailable, report the MCP version as unverified and follow the requesting repository's pinned-tool policy.

Install an approved tag:

```bash
go install github.com/irootkernel/gaori@<tag>
```

The binary does not install the agent skill. Diagnose the CLI and repository with `command -v gaori`, `gaori version --json`, and, when `.gaori/tester.yaml` exists, `gaori --json config check`. Diagnose `use-gaori`, `use-gaori-status`, and global, local, and effective MCP registration independently. Config check validates schema-v2 config and all stored rules without resolving executables, running commands, or creating evidence.

For a new user-scoped skill installation, use only these files from the automatically fetched and verified `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irootkernel/gaori/<tag>/skills/use-gaori/` payload: `SKILL.md`, `references/lifecycle.md`, `references/authoring.md`, and `references/recovery.md`. Verify the complete file set, SHA-256 digests, and `name: use-gaori` frontmatter before atomically moving it to `~/.agents/skills/use-gaori`. Repeat every raw GitHub endpoint and the user-global target in the installation proposal even though the comparison fetch itself needs no separate approval.

For `use-gaori-status`, fetch the single `SKILL.md` from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irootkernel/gaori/<tag>/skills/use-gaori-status/SKILL.md`. Verify its SHA-256 digest, complete one-file tree, and `name: use-gaori-status` frontmatter before proposing installation at `~/.agents/skills/use-gaori-status`. Apply the same per-target comparison, duplicate, backup, approval, and restart rules to each skill. A selected Gaori component diagnoses both skills, but a missing status skill does not degrade CLI, execution-skill, or MCP health.

If the target already exists, compare it with the verified source, show the complete diff, follow the shared backup policy, and obtain separate replacement approval. Under the no-backup policy, remove only the exact approved target after the incoming file set is fully verified; disclose that local modifications will not be recoverable from the release ref. Never overwrite, merge, delete, or repair another discovered copy silently. After installation or replacement, tell the user to restart Grok if the skill does not appear in the active session.

Discover required checks from repository instructions, task runners, manifests, and CI before proposing `.gaori/tester.yaml` schema version 2. Map each configured command ID to an existing argv array, non-empty tags, explicit parser, and timeout. Use `gaori --json parsers list` as the authoritative live registry before selecting a parser. Use `gaori --json parsers catalog` (`gaori-parser-catalog.v1`) for each label's code-owned support tier and output family. `dart-test`, `patrol`, `dotnet-test` and `gradle-test` are Experimental; their bounded summaries may require manual confirmation. Use `gaori --json parsers detect <raw-log>` only to diagnose an explicitly selected existing log: it reports candidates without selecting a parser, loading configuration, creating evidence, or changing the command result. Do not add secrets, absolute paths, or machine-specific arguments to portable configuration.

Gaori is an optional execution and evidence-compression wrapper; it does not create a new test gate, change command authorization, override the child process exit status, or grant acceptance. Keep runtime state local while allowing Git to track portable config and reviewed active rules. Replace a blanket `.gaori/` ignore entry only through an approved exact diff:

```gitignore
.gaori/*
!.gaori/tester.yaml
!.gaori/tester/
.gaori/tester/*
!.gaori/tester/rules/
.gaori/tester/rules/*
!.gaori/tester/rules/*.yaml
```

This keeps `.gaori/toolchain.yaml`, `.gaori/rule-proposals/`, `.gaori/runs/`, and every other Gaori path local. Active rule YAML is executable extraction policy: do not create, update, stage, or commit it without the user's specific intent and review. Validate approved config or rule changes with `gaori --json config check`. When approved redaction patterns change and the user has explicitly selected an existing raw log no larger than 256 KiB, use `gaori --json config check --sample <raw-log>` to report ordered match and replaced-byte counts without emitting matched text or pattern definitions. Do not run configured tests during setup.

Leave completed evidence and proposal reconciliation to the matching `use-gaori` skill. Its `gaori --json runs list`, `gaori --json rules proposals`, and `gaori rules show --proposal <name>` paths are read-only discovery, not repair, activation, command reruns, or durable job recovery. Never inspect prior run contents or raw logs automatically during setup.

Treat MCP as an optional, separately approved component and prefer one user-global registration in the user Grok config (`$GROK_HOME/config.toml`, default `~/.grok/config.toml`). A global registration inherits the active Grok session's working directory, so do not pin a repository path or `cwd`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.gaori]
command = "<absolute-selected-gaori-path>"
args = ["mcp"]
tool_timeout_sec = 3601
```

When the user explicitly chooses repository-local scope, merge this machine-specific alternative into `<absolute-git-root>/.grok/config.toml` while preserving unrelated configuration:

```toml
[mcp_servers.gaori]
command = "<absolute-selected-gaori-path>"
args = ["--repo", "<absolute-git-root>", "mcp"]
tool_timeout_sec = 3601
```

Show the complete diff and target scope before approval; for a local target also show whether `.grok/config.toml` is tracked. Never stage it during setup. Verify global, isolated local, and effective registrations with the same three-view procedure used for Mulgae. Global scope requires exact `args = ["mcp"]` and no fixed `cwd`; local scope requires exact `--repo <canonical-root> mcp` arguments and no fixed `cwd`. Do not start the server or a test. Require a numeric, non-boolean `tool_timeout_sec` of at least 3601 seconds so the host deadline exceeds a one-hour command and evidence finalization, while preserving any larger existing value. Report missing or inadequate timeout, disabled, non-STDIO, unresolvable-command, wrong-repository, and inactive or untrusted entries as degraded. Treat a missing `[mcp_servers.gaori]` table as absence.

Whenever an isolated local Gaori registration exists, ask whether that scope is intentional. If confirmed, preserve it even when global is preferred. If not, show and separately approve removal of only the local `gaori` table through an exact TOML edit. Apply the same backup, semantic-empty-file, empty-directory, unrelated-setting preservation, and no-staging rules as Mulgae local cleanup. Never remove the global registration as part of local cleanup.

Tell the user to restart Grok after registration changes. Verify connected capabilities from already-exposed tool metadata when available; neither registration nor a PATH CLI proves the active MCP surface. `/use-gaori` owns asynchronous execution and native fallback. [gaori-integration.md](gaori-integration.md) owns Aquarium's command and evidence handoff.

Diagnose the optional `/use-gaori-status` skill independently. It owns historical statistics and detailed timing explanations; its absence does not block execution or a live estimate supported by `/use-gaori`. Setup never queries run history or estimates automatically.

Every present repository configuration path that Gaori may inspect, including `.gaori/tester.yaml`, every descendant of `.gaori/tester/rules/`, and `.gaori/toolchain.yaml`, must have regular non-symlink lexical ancestry before any owning CLI probe may read it; an absent primary path stops that probe rather than consulting ambient state.

## Sorage

Official source: `https://github.com/irootkernel/sorage`

Supported release line: stable `v0.1.0` through `v0.1.x`, native Apple Silicon macOS only. Resolve the newest non-draft, non-prerelease tag in that range and use the same exact tag for the CLI and `use-sorage` skill. Do not automatically cross into `v0.2+`.

The official release provides `sorage-<tag>-darwin-arm64`, `sorage-<tag>-darwin-arm64.sha256`, and `sorage-<tag>-darwin-arm64.manifest.json`. Before installation, verify the checksum file, require the manifest's version, target, binary name, digest, and revision to match the selected tag, asset, and peeled tag commit, and run `codesign --verify --strict` against the binary. Disclose that the release is ad-hoc signed and not notarized. Install the separately approved regular executable to the exact user-owned target, normally `~/.local/bin/sorage`, without `sudo`; the packaged binary needs no Bun runtime. Verify the installed target with `sorage version --json`.

The binary does not install the agent skill. For a new user-scoped skill installation, use only the automatically fetched and verified `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irootkernel/sorage/<tag>/skills/use-sorage/SKILL.md` payload as `SKILL.md`. Verify the complete one-file set, its SHA-256 digest, and `name: use-sorage` frontmatter before atomically moving it to `~/.agents/skills/use-sorage`. Repeat the raw GitHub endpoint and user-global target in the installation proposal even though the comparison fetch itself needs no separate approval.

Treat missing, extra, modified, duplicate, or symlinked content as a separate skill gap. Show the complete diff and follow the shared backup and approval rules before installing or replacing it. Tell the user to restart Grok if the current session does not expose the newly installed skill.

Repository inspection diagnoses the supported CLI with the explicit `--include-sorage` path, which runs `sorage version --json`, `sorage doctor --json`, and, only when doctor has no blocking check, Project resolution. Global inspection always checks the version and uses `--include-sorage-initialization` to add only the doctor path. The version command returns the bare `{name, version}` object; doctor returns a versioned Sorage envelope. Accept doctor state only when all 20 v0.1 catalog IDs appear once in their specified order with valid fields and `ok`, `warning`, or `blocking` severity. Doctor exits `0` when no check is blocking and `1` when any check is blocking. The all-blocking catalog with `sorage init` recovery identifies an uninitialized installation. Any partial, reordered, or otherwise invalid catalog is unverifiable.

These commands make no network request. Doctor opens the local database for some checks, and Project resolution uses Sorage's native open-and-migrate path, so the selected diagnosis may update local database or journal state. Disclose this before running the selected Sorage diagnosis. Without the applicable include flag, inventory runs only version and platform checks: a supported CLI reports `not_inspected`, while an unsupported version or platform reports `degraded`.

Summarize only check counts by `ok`, `warning`, and `blocking`. Never copy check messages, request IDs, Installation IDs, Vault paths, database paths, tokens, or other private state into the setup report. A warning does not block the minimal local profile, while any blocking check prevents readiness.

When Sorage is not initialized, separately propose this minimal profile:

```bash
sorage init --non-interactive --json
```

Show the exact effective `SORAGE_HOME` and default Vault paths before approval. This command creates the home tree, config, database, API token, and managed Vault, but does not start the daemon, install a LaunchAgent, initialize Vault Git, enable backup, or configure push. Preserve an existing valid installation. Treat `--reconfigure`, daemon or service setup, Vault movement, backup, restore, and uninstall as distinct native Sorage operations with their own exact proposals; never edit the managed Vault directly.

After initialization, run `sorage project resolve --path <canonical-git-root> --json`. Read no inbox, outbox, Handoff title, Review Note, or Artifact during setup. Readiness requires an active Project whose selected binding kind is `git_repository`; a containing `directory` binding does not register the repository itself.

If resolution returns a registered Project through a containing `directory` binding, report a non-ready binding-kind gap and preserve the existing binding. Stop automatic setup for that repository, require a separate explicit native repair decision, and do not propose `project add` or `project bind` from that result.

Treat only a successful `unregistered_workspace` result as `registration_required`. In that case, disclose that `sorage project list --json` opens the same local database and may apply native migrations, then obtain separate explicit approval before running it. Only after that approved listing may you ask whether to create a new Project or bind an existing active one. A native resolution error is `resolution_error`. Preserve its symbolic code, leave Project registration unverifiable, and do not propose `project add` or `project bind`.

Require an exact user-confirmed display name and immutable slug for creation:

```bash
sorage project add --name <name> --slug <slug> --dir <canonical-git-root> --json
sorage project bind <existing-active-slug> --dir <canonical-git-root> --json
```

Do not guess Project identity, use `--allow-unregistered`, or silently unarchive a Project. An archived Project requires a separately approved `sorage project unarchive <slug> --as-user --json`. On `AMBIGUOUS_PROJECT`, `BINDING_DUPLICATE`, `PROJECT_SLUG_CONFLICT`, `VAULT_CONTAINMENT`, or another native error, preserve state and return its symbolic code. Re-resolve the exact Git root after mutation and require the active `git_repository` result before reporting registration complete.

Require the whole `.sorage/` directory to be ignored, with no tracked descendant and no symlinked `.sorage/` path. Prefer the local exclude file returned by `git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude`, show its exact addition of `.sorage/`, and obtain separate approval. Offer a tracked `.gitignore` change only when the user asks for repository-wide policy. If any `.sorage/` path is already tracked, report the conflict and stop rather than editing, deleting, or untracking it.

A healthy supported CLI remains `installed` when initialization, registration, Project state, binding kind, skill, ignore, tracking, or symlink readiness is incomplete. Use `degraded` for an unhealthy runtime, invalid command contract, or blocking doctor result other than the exact uninitialized catalog. Report that catalog as `installed` with `readiness_status: initialization_required`, and use `configured` only for complete readiness. Once setup is ready, route session-start and pre-task discovery plus every Handoff, review, retention, deletion, and Vault operation through `/use-sorage`.

## Lora / Lore

Official source: `https://github.com/tmdgusya/lora`

Lora distributes agent skills rather than a runtime service. Configure it for user-global scope under `~/.agents/skills`. Resolve the latest stable tag when one exists; otherwise resolve the full current `main` commit SHA and disclose that fallback before approval. Because `npx skills add <repository>#<full-sha>` treats the SHA as a branch name, prepare a temporary detached checkout at the approved commit and install from that local source instead.

Install only the two compatible skills from the approved ref:

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --no-checkout https://github.com/tmdgusya/lora <temporary-source-root>/lora
git -C <temporary-source-root>/lora fetch --depth=1 origin <approved-tag-or-full-sha>
git -C <temporary-source-root>/lora checkout --detach FETCH_HEAD
git -C <temporary-source-root>/lora rev-parse HEAD
npx skills add <temporary-source-root>/lora \
  --skill lore-commits \
  --skill lore-query \
  --global \
  --agent grok \
  --copy \
  --yes
```

The clone and fetch contact GitHub, and `npx` contacts npm and writes `lore-commits` and `lore-query` to `~/.agents/skills/lore-commits` and `~/.agents/skills/lore-query`. Require the detached `HEAD` to equal the approved ref before installation. Do not install or invoke Lora's `lore-setup`; it copies the full Lore protocol into AGENTS.md and conflicts with the reference-and-override policy. If `lore-setup` is already installed, report it without removing or rewriting it.

Before updating an existing `lore-commits` or `lore-query`, compare its complete installed file set with the approved source, show the target and diff, and apply the shared backup policy before the approved `npx skills add` action. Under the no-backup policy, disclose that local modifications will not be recoverable from the source ref. After installation, enumerate both complete source and target trees, reject missing and extra paths, and compare every regular file byte-for-byte; any symlink or digest mismatch fails verification. The bundled inspector reports only structural presence and frontmatter as `unverifiable`, never complete-source currency. Do not report configured until this post-action complete-tree comparison passes. Do not treat installation as commit authority.

## Cursor Team Kit / Deslop

Official source: `https://github.com/cursor/plugins`

Deslop is a separately installed upstream prerequisite, not an Aquarium skill. This integration has no supported skill-specific release line, so resolve and disclose the full current `main` commit SHA through official GitHub commit metadata, then prepare a temporary detached checkout at that exact commit. Never install from a moving `main` or use a full SHA as an `npx skills` URL fragment.

Install only the upstream Deslop skill from the approved checkout and preserve its parent plugin's MIT notice:

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --no-checkout https://github.com/cursor/plugins <temporary-source-root>/cursor-plugins
git -C <temporary-source-root>/cursor-plugins fetch --depth=1 origin <approved-full-sha>
git -C <temporary-source-root>/cursor-plugins checkout --detach FETCH_HEAD
git -C <temporary-source-root>/cursor-plugins rev-parse HEAD
npx skills add <temporary-source-root>/cursor-plugins/cursor-team-kit \
  --skill deslop \
  --global \
  --agent grok \
  --copy \
  --yes
install -m 0644 <temporary-source-root>/cursor-plugins/cursor-team-kit/LICENSE ~/.agents/skills/deslop/LICENSE
```

The clone and fetch contact GitHub, and `npx` contacts npm and writes `~/.agents/skills/deslop`. Show every endpoint, command, approved SHA, target, source digest, and expected file before installation approval. Verify that the installed `SKILL.md` and LICENSE are byte-identical to the detached checkout, the frontmatter is exactly `name: deslop`, the target contains no extra files, and no duplicate or symlink installation exists in another agent skill root.

If the target exists, compare its complete tree with the approved source plus LICENSE, show the complete diff, apply the shared backup policy, and obtain separate replacement approval. Never merge an Aquarium variant or local customization into the upstream payload. After installation or replacement, clean up the ephemeral checkout when possible and tell the user to restart Grok before resuming the requesting Aquarium workflow.

## Humanizer

Official source: `https://github.com/blader/humanizer`

Resolve the supported `v2.11.1` release through official GitHub release metadata, prepare a temporary detached checkout at that exact tag, and require `HEAD` to equal the resolved release commit. The complete install payload is the root `SKILL.md` and `LICENSE`; require regular non-symlink files, `name: humanizer`, and frontmatter version `2.11.1`.

Install the verified two-file payload at `~/.agents/skills/humanizer` only after separate approval. Compare the complete source and target trees and every digest, rejecting missing or extra paths, symlinks, invalid frontmatter, a non-v2 or mismatched version, and duplicates in other agent skill roots. Never execute Humanizer or rewrite prose during setup.

## im-not-ai

Official source: `https://github.com/epoko77-ai/im-not-ai`

Resolve the supported `v2.3.2` release through official GitHub release metadata, prepare a temporary detached checkout at that exact tag, and require `HEAD` to equal the resolved release commit. Read the checked-out `install.sh` and require every write target to derive from the isolated temporary `CODEX_HOME`. Disclose the exact `./install.sh --codex-only --copy` command and temporary target and obtain separate approval for that upstream-code execution, then run it without `--force`. Reject unexpected writes outside that isolated directory, then add the checkout's root LICENSE to the generated `humanize-korean` directory.

Require the materialized payload to contain only regular non-symlink files, the exact generated tree, and `name: humanize-korean`. Install that complete payload at `~/.agents/skills/humanize-korean` only after separate approval. Then compare every path and digest and reject duplicates in other agent skill roots. Never point the active skill target at a checkout, run the installer against an active skill root, invoke the skill, or create `_workspace/` during setup.

## Podway

Official source: `https://github.com/irootkernel/podway`

Supported release line: stable `v0.2.9` through `v0.2.x`, native Apple Silicon macOS only. Resolve the newest non-draft, non-prerelease tag in that range. Use the same exact release tag for the CLI and daemon. Podway v0.2.5 has migrated reset-receipt read-back, degraded-store reset recovery, and bounded correlated daemon-log guarantees; v0.2.6 satisfies Aquarium's Procedure and prepared-session contracts but lacks the exact-workspace removal contract and matching source-distributed skill guidance, while v0.2.7 lacks named runtime modes and daemon-status v3, and v0.2.8 lacks successful UUID-fenced workspace-removal replay. Do not automatically cross into `v0.3+`.

Pin the optional `use-podway` skill independently to full commit `9014225982e4c316237e0d6e35052414d2dbc770`. This skill hotfix adds context recovery and Codex goal coordination guidance on top of v0.2.9 without requiring a new runtime. Keep this skill pin until an explicit catalog update replaces it; a newer release, including v0.2.10, does not change the pin.

Resolve the exact release from GitHub Releases and download the Apple Silicon archive plus its published `.sha256` file. Disclose that release binaries are unsigned and not notarized. Verify with `shasum -a 256 -c` before installing both `podway` and `podwayd` at the approved user-local paths. Do not accept a prerelease, a version before v0.2.9, `v0.3+`, an unverified archive, mixed CLI and daemon versions, or unsupported platform.

The binaries do not install the agent skill. Diagnose `use-podway` independently in the agent skill roots. For a new user-scoped installation, use only `SKILL.md`, `references/lifecycle.md`, `references/goal.md`, and `references/recovery.md` from the automatically fetched and verified `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irootkernel/podway/9014225982e4c316237e0d6e35052414d2dbc770/skills/use-podway/` payload. Verify the commit through the official repository, the complete file set, SHA-256 digests, and `name: use-podway` frontmatter before atomically moving it to `~/.agents/skills/use-podway`. Repeat every raw GitHub endpoint and the user-global target in the installation proposal even though the comparison fetch itself needs no separate approval. Keep `create-podway-procedure` as a separately installed maintainer authoring dependency; neither setup skill installs, compares, or requires it.

If the target exists, compare it with the verified source, show the complete diff, follow the shared backup policy, and obtain separate replacement approval. Under the no-backup policy, remove only the exact approved target after the incoming file set is fully verified; disclose that local modifications will not be recoverable from the pinned source commit. Never overwrite, merge, delete, or repair another discovered copy silently. After installation or replacement, tell the user to restart Grok so a new session loads the skill snapshot.

Install or refresh the per-user service only after separate approval:

```bash
podway daemon install --daemon-path <absolute-podwayd-path>
podway daemon status --json
```

If that install is interrupted after authenticated service metadata is prepared, rerun the same approved command with the same absolute daemon path and no `--socket` override. Podway v0.2.5 reconciles the prepared receipt and waits for the prior launchd label to unload before replacement bootstrap. Never edit service metadata, sockets, receipts, or LaunchAgent files to recover the installation.

Podway v0.2.5 writes daemon events as bounded fixed-schema `podway.daemon-log/v1` JSONL with opaque request, workspace, session, job, and diagnostic correlation. It keeps at most ten 1-MiB daemon-log files and a separate daemon-owned five-file bootstrap stream while LaunchAgent standard output and error go to `/dev/null`. Treat these logs as bounded diagnostics, not lifecycle authority, and never expose raw log contents in setup reports.

The LaunchAgent runs after GUI login under the same OS user and is not a multi-user security boundary. Verify the compact `podway version --json` result, bounded `podway --json daemon wait-ready --timeout 120s` output with a `podway.output/v3` envelope and `podway.daemon-status-result/v3`, daemon reachability and exact version match, and the `podway.output/v3` doctor envelope when the worktree is initialized. Require `mode=prod`, `readiness_state=ready`, `readiness_stage=ready`, null or bounded activity counts, and closed `worktree_recovery` with every worktree completed; a nonzero failed count may describe quarantined completed recovery and is not independently unhealthy. The read-only readiness inspector may inventory a session through `podway.status-result/v3` or `podway.compact-status-result/v3`; managed workflow automation must use `podway observe --json --wait-for-idle` and require `podway.observation-result/v3`. Treat `readback[].items[].preview` as bounded metadata, never a complete item value. Read a selected complete value with digest-bound `podway --json evidence read --source <source> --item <item>`, continue with each returned page token until complete, and on `EVIDENCE_PAGE_TOKEN_STALE` re-observe and restart the read. Prepared lifecycle mutations use `podway.session-start-result/v3`, `podway.session-begin-result/v1`, `podway.terminal-disposition-result/v1`, and `podway.session-reset-result/v1`; prepared-aware lifecycle jobs use `podway.job-result/v4` and `podway.job-lookup-result/v4`. Errors remain `podway.error/v1`.

`start` creates a prepared revision-0 session without a cursor, attempt, or goal. The owning handler must re-observe it and use the fresh fenced `session.begin` mutation template to create attempt 1 and any initial goal before recording evidence. Derive every lifecycle mutation from the latest observation template and current `podway help <route>` grammar. The current start policy preserves a prepared or running session unless an explicitly authorized `--on-existing delete` is selected; plain `start` automatically archives an eligible disposed terminal predecessor. `list`, `show`, and `archive purge` expose inactive history, whose hard limit is 32 sessions; never auto-purge or evict history. Terminal sessions expose a disposition template until the exact current revision records `handed_off` or `not_required`. Never infer a removed replacement flag from the internal `session.start_replace` template name or substitute force reset for missing handoff authority.

Treat that bounded inventory as readiness evidence only. Never use dev-setup to observe, cancel, discard, or reset a routine supported Procedure v2 current session; return an exact standalone `/use-podway` lifecycle request instead. Keep `LEGACY_PROCEDURE_STATE_UNSUPPORTED` and its separately approved workspace-wide `podway reset --all` recovery as the only session-state reset exception in this catalog.

`workspace remove` is not a dev-setup repair, cleanup, uninstallation, or readiness action. A missing session, stale registry entry, setup opt-out, or request to remove one session never authorizes complete `.podway` deletion. Only an explicit request to stop using Podway in one exact Git worktree may hand off to the pinned `/use-podway` lifecycle flow, which must disclose complete `.podway` deletion, preserve the Git worktree, re-read the exact root and workspace UUID immediately before mutation, and require `podway.workspace-removal-result/v1` before reporting success.

`workspace mode apply` is not a dev-setup repair or readiness action. Dev-setup may report a mode mismatch, but it must not plan or apply a mode move. Only an explicit exact-worktree and target-mode request may hand off to the pinned `/use-podway` lifecycle flow. That flow must disclose the tracked `.podway/config.yaml` rewrite and complete runtime-history deletion. It must also keep the plan token ephemeral, revalidate the source workspace UUID and both modes, and obtain separate approval immediately before apply. After apply or recovery replay, require current target-mode observation and report the configuration change without staging or committing it.

Repository initialization and Aquarium readiness configuration require another approval. `podway init` creates `.podway/config.yaml` and `.podway/.gitignore` for the repository to track, plus ignored `.podway/runtime/`. Install missing or explicitly selected canonical Procedure v2 sources to `.podway/procedures/` byte-for-byte and validate each safe present file with the selected Podway v0.2.9 binary:

```bash
podway procedure check --warnings-as-errors <procedure-file>
podway procedure preview <procedure-file>
```

The five required IDs are `aquarium-task-v2`, `aquarium-goal-v2`, `aquarium-validation-v2`, `aquarium-design-v2`, and `aquarium-war-room-v2`. Their presence describes readiness, never workflow activation. Require regular non-symlink files and non-symlink path components before hashing or invoking Podway; a symlinked managed path is degraded and must never be read or executed. Match each expected filename to the `procedure_id` returned by preview, and let Podway own document validity. Report each file as `canonical`, `valid_customization`, `invalid`, `missing`, `unsafe`, or `unverifiable`. All absent means `readiness_status=not_configured`; all five tracked, same-ID, Podway-valid files with healthy runtime state mean `readiness_status=ready` even when one or more are valid local customizations. Partial, invalid, unsafe, unverifiable, unsupported, or unhealthy state means `readiness_status=degraded`. Repository inspection omits Podway unless invoked with `--include-podway`.

For every valid customization, show the exact current-to-canonical diff and ask whether to preserve the local file or replace it with canonical bytes. Preserve means no write and no metadata. Replacement applies the shared backup policy, rechecks the exact target snapshot, and requires approval for that one diff. Never overwrite, merge, normalize, or reformat local content under a broader setup approval; an active session retains its immutable snapshot.

The renamed inspector reports `migration_required=true` and `migration_kinds.product_rename=true` when any tracked or untracked `root-kernel-task-v2.yaml`, `root-kernel-goal-v2.yaml`, or `root-kernel-validation-v2.yaml` remains in `.podway/procedures/`. This is a product-rename migration and forces degraded readiness until the old files are separately removed and the `aquarium-*` files are installed. Finish or explicitly dispose of any active old session first; never convert or delete its runtime history as part of managed-file replacement.

The repository inspector keeps exact prior-canonical digests and the deterministic v0.2.5 workaround identity only as per-file `update_explanation` values. These values can explain an offered canonical update but never create a separate validity, migration, ownership, or readiness class. Any same-ID file that Podway accepts remains a `valid_customization`; any replacement still requires its exact current-to-canonical diff and explicit choice. Do not create an ownership manifest, provenance registry, or second workaround source.

`LEGACY_PROCEDURE_STATE_UNSUPPORTED` has a different meaning: the runtime contains Procedure v1 task state. Do not convert, edit, or delete that state automatically. Report the exact worktree and error and apply the shared backup policy before separately proposing the supported `podway reset --all` recovery. Under the no-backup policy, disclose that the reset permanently deletes the legacy runtime history and that Git cannot restore it, then require separate explicit approval.

Podway v0.2.5 also preserves explicit confirmed `podway reset --all` recovery when the workspace binding is readable but disposable full-store openability or internal-codec inspection fails. Treat that condition as degraded, preserve the exact stable error evidence, apply the shared backup policy, and require a separate reset proposal and explicit approval; recoverability never grants deletion authority.

## Ouroboros

Official source: `https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros`. Python package: `ouroboros-ai`. Support only `>=0.51.1,<0.54.0`, including 0.53; future minor lines require compatibility review. Preserve the upstream interview, PM, Seed, and QA interfaces. Seed QA in 0.53 is advisory; do not add a blocking QA-until-PASS loop.

### Package and Home Discovery

The CLI is installed once per user. On this host, install the packaged Ouroboros skills under `~/.agents/skills`, which Grok reads natively, and register the MCP server in `~/.grok/config.toml`. `ooo setup --runtime grok` configures Ouroboros runtime selection in `~/.ouroboros/config.yaml` and does not write the Grok MCP entry.

Run `dev-setup-global/scripts/inspect_global_tools.py --component ouroboros --verify-ouroboros-release`. Disclose `https://pypi.org/pypi/ouroboros-ai/json` before the read-only request. The lookup excludes prereleases and withdrawn releases and reports the installed version, latest stable release, latest supported release, and whether compatibility review is required. A failed lookup, including an HTTP protocol error, is `freshness_unverifiable` and preserves the other inspection results. If the CLI exists but its version probe fails or returns no parseable version, freshness is `freshness_unverifiable` with reason `cli_version_unverifiable`; successfully fetched release metadata remains available. Only an absent CLI is `missing` after a successful lookup. Without the flag, freshness is `not_checked` and the inspector makes no network request. Resolve and approve an exact package version; do not install a moving range.

The inspector includes `$GROK_HOME` (default `~/.grok`) as the host config home. Add extra Ouroboros homes with repeatable `--grok-home <path>` only when the user names them. Never search repository trees. Resolve relative paths against the invocation directory, merge aliases of the same directory, and never search repository trees. A missing active or explicitly selected home remains a missing installation target; an unrelated directory is not a discovered home.

Reject blank `--grok-home` values before probing; preserve spaces in nonblank paths. An explicit home that is a regular file remains an `invalid_grok_home` input error. If the automatically selected active home is a regular file, return a degraded home row with reason `home_not_a_directory` and skip its doctor and MCP probes. Keep the CLI observation and continue inspecting other homes and components. If an automatic home cannot be resolved, retain its original spelling with `home_resolution_failed` and skip its probes. Discovery failures and otherwise unhandled path errors during home inspection degrade the affected home with `home_inspection_failed`; artifact read failures remain component-specific. Do not convert diagnosis failures into explicit-input errors.

Propose all discovered homes by default and list them before approval. Separate `current_home_readiness` from `all_discovered_homes_readiness`. A failure in another home does not block an otherwise ready current home. Report partial results without rolling back successful independent homes.

### Independent Inspection

Inspect the CLI through `ooo --version` once. Resolve packaged artifacts through the interpreter beside the selected uv-installed CLI. Compare each home's complete rules and skill file trees independently using SHA-256. Compare the primary rules file with `load_packaged_codex_rules()` output, which includes upstream-generated runtime guidance; compare other assets with their packaged bytes. Missing files, changed bytes, extra managed files, and symlinks are gaps. Do not infer artifact health from `ooo codex doctor`: that command also checks MCP. If the selected package's assets cannot be resolved or its version differs from the CLI observation, report artifact verification as unavailable rather than using a shared skill copy.

Read the Grok `[mcp_servers.ouroboros]` table from `~/.grok/config.toml` (or `$GROK_HOME/config.toml`) without starting the server. Registration is `configured` only for an enabled named `ouroboros` STDIO entry matching either the selected `ooo` executable with exactly `args = ["mcp", "serve"]` or the canonical isolated launcher. The isolated form uses the selected `uvx`, ordered `--isolated --python >=3.12 --from ouroboros-ai[mcp]` arguments with an optional supported exact pin, and `ouroboros mcp serve`. It selects Grok through `OUROBOROS_AGENT_RUNTIME=grok` or the exact suffix `--runtime grok`. Do not start the server with `grok mcp doctor`.

Grok does not bind Ouroboros MCP to a per-home environment variable. Report host skills under `~/.agents/skills` and MCP from `~/.grok/config.toml` independently of leftover per-home artifact trees. Isolated launcher registration is `configured` when it matches the Grok runtime contract; package pin comparison is not a per-home readiness gate on this host.

Run `ooo mcp doctor --json` only for a direct selected-CLI registration. For an isolated launcher, report configured runtime state from its own launcher contract without probing the unrelated base MCP environment. These local probes do not start an MCP server, contact a provider, authenticate, or expose credentials. Normalize errors and reason codes; never print raw registration output or secrets. Definite named-server-not-found is missing; malformed, disabled, timed-out, or failed probes are degraded; an unreadable Grok config is unverifiable.

### Approved Upgrade and Migration

Installation requires an existing `uv`. Show `uv tool install ouroboros-ai==<exact-version>` or the exact native upgrade command and package endpoints. Do not install `uv` as a side effect. Show the CLI action, every selected home, rules/skills changes, MCP changes, expected shared Ouroboros configuration effects, backup policy, and verification together. One approval may cover all listed actions; do not ask again for individual homes already covered. Changes outside that proposal require additional approval. Re-read targets before mutation and invalidate approval if they changed.

For existing integration, use `ooo setup refresh` as the rules-and-skills repair alternative. For full configuration, use `ooo setup --runtime grok --non-interactive`. Do not run refresh before full setup. Refresh does not prune obsolete managed artifacts; if those remain, propose full setup with its complete effects. Do not copy or patch upstream skill content.

`--mcp-mode auto` may preserve a user-managed mismatch and return success. Reinspect the actual registration; that result is not a completed repair. Offer preservation with the unresolved gap or an explicitly approved canonical replacement using `--mcp-mode stdio` on supported hosts. Include the exact MCP adjustments needed after native setup in the original proposal: pin the isolated MCP package to the approved CLI version in `~/.grok/config.toml`. Use an exact TOML edit confined to the Ouroboros entry; preserve unrelated settings and comments. Never write one active home into every discovered home's registration. Respect native platform limitations instead of substituting an unsupported mode.

Report `legacy_shared_skills` as migration candidates, not removal authority. Identify prefixed copies and inspect older unprefixed copies against verified upstream content before including them. Show the exact paths and backup/removal steps in the migration proposal. Install and verify the selected homes before removing only approved legacy copies. Never delete unrelated shared skills or require removing a valid copy in another home.

### Completion and Runtime Switching

Verify package version, independent rules/skills, aggregate doctor, registration, package pin, and home binding after each action. The read-only inspector reports configuration readiness and leaves `live_runtime` as `not_observed`. After changing homes or MCP settings, restart the affected Grok session as needed and use safely observable host evidence to confirm the running server and child process uses the same home. Tool exposure alone does not prove the process environment. If that evidence is unavailable, report it explicitly rather than claiming runtime verification.

No setup action authorizes a provider call, authentication, repository-source transmission, `auto`, `run`, `ralph`, `evolve`, Seed creation, or an Aquarium design workflow. Do not switch accounts automatically or clear persisted quota-pause state. Correct home routing does not by itself prove an earlier usage-limit failure is resolved.
