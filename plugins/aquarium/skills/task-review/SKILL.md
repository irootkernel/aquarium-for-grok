# Task Review

Read [mulgae-review-contract.md](../../references/mulgae-review-contract.md) for Aquarium review inputs, terminal evidence, recovery acceptance, and round counting.

Review only the complete implementation, tests, refinement, and review-state documentation for the task established by `/aquarium:task-handler`. Always read [evidence-residency.md](../../references/evidence-residency.md) and [finding-disposition.md](../../references/finding-disposition.md). Require the handler-provided positive review ordinal, current goal revision, and `remediation-eligible` or `confirmation-only` mode when delegated; a direct invocation is one isolated report-only round with ordinal one and grants no remediation or later-round budget.

One invocation consumes one round only after the full-target root or its verified composite reaches committed publication with complete coverage and a successful findings query, including a `request_changes` policy outcome or failing CI decision. Count once per original root under the shared Mulgae contract; reads, internal retry or extraction, exact recovery reruns, and composition do not consume another round.

Corrections returned to an owning phase change the diff and invalidate affected prior evidence, including implementation and verification evidence when behavior or tests change. The handler records the structured `ci-decision`, then selects `ci-failed` through its explicit failure handoff or selects `implementation-changes` or `documentation-changes` for the exact owning phase; only `ci-decision=pass` with no unresolved valid finding and no file change supports `approved`.

## Run and Resolve the Mulgae Review

1. Follow repository-specific Mulgae instructions and the shared contract's prerequisite routing. Keep the task in review when a required prerequisite is missing; setup changes belong to the routed setup skill.
2. Select one target containing the complete task diff and excluding unrelated work. Stop when safe isolation cannot be established.
3. Supply `/use-mulgae` with that target, roles, and a bounded objective naming the task, goal revision, review ordinal, and review mode. Delegate native preflight, execution, waiting, and any authorized exact recovery under the shared contract.
4. Consume the terminal root or verified composite result. Keep execution completion, CI decision, extraction quality, and local finding dispositions separate. Pending execution and unavailable publication authority cannot support a review decision.
5. Treat every finding as an advisory hypothesis. Preserve its reported severity, verify it against the roadmap, current code, and tests, assign its effective priority, and select the applicable shared disposition.
6. Adjudicate every finding but do not change files. In delegated `remediation-eligible` mode, return valid findings through the owning phase with required checks and re-review status. A direct invocation reports findings and the exact `/aquarium:task-handler` continuation without mutation. In `confirmation-only` mode, return Medium-or-higher findings for bounded user authorization and return eligible Low handling to the approved owning envelope without granting another provider review.
7. Return unresolved operational gaps under the shared recovery and round-counting rules. Target changes require the handler's next full-target review; recovery of an older capture cannot prove corrected bytes.

## Bound the Evidence

Apply the shared contract's operational-completion and extraction-quality rules. Task approval separately requires passing CI and zero unresolved valid findings. Keep those outcomes explicit in the handoff; provider success or process exit alone cannot approve the task.

Do not count a cancelled lane, operational failure, incomplete capture, unavailable findings query, or unverified finding as successful review evidence. Do not commit or publish in this phase.

Mulgae retains complete provider stdout and stderr without a product byte ceiling. Keep raw transcripts, accepted reports, extraction artifacts, and credential-profile paths in private Mulgae runtime state.

Verify every finding locally, but bound the orchestrator handoff to counts by reported severity, effective priority, validity, and disposition plus at most 20 highest-priority records containing only finding ID, reported severity, effective priority, validity, disposition, and affected repository-relative paths.

When more remain, include the omitted count and authoritative run/findings identity or digest. Never include descriptions, quotes, credential-profile paths, or raw provider payloads.

Return the exact target, goal revision, review ordinal and mode, preflight summary, run and session IDs, command exit codes, operational-completion status, CI decision, adjudicated findings, whether the review predates any corrected bytes, missing authority, and remaining operational gaps to the orchestrator.
