description: "Prepare and create one authorized Git commit while reconciling roadmap task lifecycle state and preserving unrelated work. Use when the user asks to commit in a repository that may contain a roadmap, when an Aquarium handler hands off an approved commit, or when a direct roadmap-repository commit must pass the Aquarium commit gate."

# Task Commit

Create one authorized commit through a shared roadmap-aware boundary. Read [evidence-residency.md](../../references/evidence-residency.md) and [release-notes.md](../../references/release-notes.md). This skill owns commit preparation and execution, including one explicitly approved release-note hunk when needed, not implementation evidence, task completion judgment, Podway mutation, publication, or release.

## Establish the Commit Boundary

1. Resolve the Git root and read all applicable instructions, commit conventions, branch and upstream state, staged, unstaged, untracked, and conflicted changes.
2. Resolve effective `user.name` and `user.email` with their Git configuration scopes and origins. Require a non-empty winning value for each key from `local` or `worktree` scope; system, global, and command scope do not satisfy this repository-specific identity requirement even when their values match. Record the exact values, scopes, and origins as the commit identity snapshot. Do not create `.aquarium`, another identity file, or a duplicate configuration owner.
3. Identify tracked roadmap candidates: paths whose basename or directory contains `roadmap` and whose content defines lifecycle states such as `In Progress`, `In Review`, `Completed`, `Blocked`, or `Deferred`. Read the relevant task entries and their exact vocabulary.
4. Inspect the current Grok todo list. When Podway was not explicitly opted out for the managed workflow, inspect only the bounded current-session facts needed to reconcile the commit with active Aquarium work. The commit boundary itself does not mutate Podway, but the same Aquarium caller may record the verified post-commit disposition immediately afterward.
5. Record the requested commit scope and authority. A request to commit authorizes neither amend, push, PR changes, release work, destructive actions, nor unrelated staging.
6. Inspect Project Configuration for the exact `Aquarium release notes: <repository-relative-path>` declaration. When enrolled, run the release-handler's read-only inspector and require exactly one structurally valid open target unless the commit is the release commit that closes it or the separately approved post-release commit that opens its successor.

When a commit belongs to active Podway-managed Aquarium work, require an explicit commit handoff from the current Aquarium execution context. Accept it regardless of which Aquarium skill started or advanced the session; never require returning to a prior skill. Do not offer an independent path around the managed workflow's approvals and evidence.

## Reconcile Roadmap Context

When the commit is outside managed workflow work:

- If no roadmap candidate exists, follow repository commit rules without inventing a task relationship or lifecycle edit.
- If no `In Progress` or `In Review` task exists, do not invent one. Preserve existing terminal states and proceed only with the user's commit scope.
- If one or more `In Progress` or `In Review` tasks exist, always ask whether the commit belongs to one exact task or is unrelated to every listed task. Never infer the relationship from changed files, branch names, commit text, goals, or conversation context. With multiple candidates, require an exact task ID. Allow the user to cancel. The initial commit request does not satisfy this dedicated confirmation, even when it already names a task or checkpoint; first show the current candidates, status, and exact proposed scope.
- For an unrelated commit, preserve every task status exactly and exclude unrelated roadmap edits from the commit unless separately authorized.
- For a selected task already in a roadmap-defined terminal state, preserve that state. For a selected non-terminal task, show the exact current status and require the user to select one roadmap-defined terminal state, explicitly authorize a checkpoint commit that preserves the exact current status, or cancel. Offer only terminal states the roadmap actually defines, including `Completed`, `Blocked`, or `Deferred` when present. Never choose a terminal state for the user. When the roadmap defines none, offer only the explicit checkpoint and cancel paths.
- Treat checkpoint authorization as one-commit authority only. Report that the task remains active, do not represent the checkpoint as closeout, and reconcile lifecycle state again on every later commit request.

A handler commit handoff must include:

- repository, canonical roadmap path, exact task or epic ID, exact commit scope, and the user's commit authorization;
- the lifecycle decision as either an exact approved edit or an explicit statement that no lifecycle edit applies;
- the record decision as either an exact approved edit or an explicit statement that no record edit applies;
- verification and review evidence identifying command, actor, exit status, reviewed snapshot, verdict, and review run when applicable, with inapplicable fields marked explicitly.
- the release-note decision as exact `entry` text already present in the approved diff, `intentional no-note`, or `not-enrolled`;
- zero or more staged promoted-evidence manifest paths paired with exact `sha256:<64-hex>` manifest digests and the owning workflow's current native-evidence, native-target-digest, and copied-projection validation result, or an explicit statement that no promoted evidence applies;
- for an epic member task with a hardening deferral, the exact current Mulgae run and finding IDs used only for pre-commit verification, or an explicit statement that no hardening deferral applies.

Reject a stale, ambiguous, or incomplete handoff rather than reconstructing approval.

A release-handler commit handoff must name the repository, intended and previous versions, exact operation (`settlement`, `retarget`, `release`, or `next-cycle`), changelog path and approved hunk, exact commit scope, `intentional no-note`, applicable QA and release-gate evidence or their explicit inapplicability, and the user's one-commit authorization. It grants no push, tag, hosted Release, destructive replacement, or later commit authority.

For a direct commit without a managed-workflow handoff, inspect the complete intended diff and require the user to approve one exact concise entry or `intentional no-note` when release notes are enrolled. If an entry is needed but absent, show one proposed changelog hunk and obtain approval before applying it.

Apply no other documentation change, re-run the release-notes inspector and applicable documentation check, and treat the resulting hunk as part of the final commit scope. Any earlier commit approval that did not include those bytes is stale. For an unenrolled repository record `not-enrolled` and do not create or infer an authority.

## Prepare the Exact Commit

Apply only the lifecycle or record edit explicitly selected by the user or supplied by a valid handler handoff. Preserve the selected task's exact current state for an approved checkpoint. Any other code, test, documentation, or roadmap change after approval makes that approval stale.

Require the release-note decision to match the final diff. An `entry` must appear exactly once under the current open target in the authorized changelog path. `intentional no-note` normally permits no changelog edit, and `not-enrolled` is valid only when no authority is declared.

With an exact `/aquarium:release-handler` handoff, `intentional no-note` may include only the approved settlement, open-target retarget, release heading transition with unchanged entry bytes, or empty next-cycle section. Reject a stale target, missing decision, mismatched entry, self-referential settlement entry, unapproved note edit, or rewrite of completed release history.

Stage only the authorized paths or hunks. Preserve unrelated staged and unstaged work; stop if the commit scope cannot be isolated safely. Immediately before committing, re-read the staged roadmap entry, `git diff --cached`, staged tree and blob identities, and full Git status. Confirm that:

- the effective repository-specific `user.name` and `user.email`, including their scopes and origins, still match the commit identity snapshot;
- the selected task relationship and approved terminal or unchanged-checkpoint status still match the user's answer;
- the handler handoff's lifecycle or record edit, including an explicit absence, still matches the staged snapshot;
- a declared unrelated commit contains no unintended task lifecycle transition;
- the reviewed implementation, approved lifecycle or record decision, and any approved post-review promoted-evidence packages equal the staged diff;
- unrelated pre-existing staged content is absent from the intended commit.

Before a non-trivial commit, reference `/lore-commits` and follow it when available. Repository-required IDs and prefixes override Lore, which never grants commit authority. If Lore is required but unavailable, stop and return an exact `/aquarium:dev-setup` continuation request. Otherwise report its absence once, inspect `git log -5 --format=fuller`, and match the recurring subject, body, and trailer structure; inspect all commits when fewer than five exist and use a concise imperative subject when none exist.

When a handler handoff includes one or more promoted-evidence packages:

- Resolve the evidence root from the applicable repository `AGENTS.md` Project Configuration or use `evidence/aquarium/` when none is declared. Require one unambiguous repository-relative tracked root; reject ignored, outside-repository, or symlinked roots and paths.
- Require each manifest to use `aquarium.promoted-evidence/v1`, contain no runtime identity, match an approved purpose and work unit, bind the owning workflow's supplied verified native target SHA-256 and capture-time Git object ID, and list only staged regular non-symlink payloads beneath its package directory. Reject a missing, stale, or mismatched owning-workflow validation result and prohibited private content under the shared contract.
- Recompute every staged payload digest and the staged manifest digest. Require the supplied digest to use exactly one `sha256:` prefix and match the exact `manifest.json` bytes. Reject any path, byte, target, schema, content, or digest mismatch.
- Reject any staged modification, replacement, move, or deletion of an existing tracked package. A changed package uses a new directory named by the verified native target digest.
- Add one repeatable `Aquarium-Evidence: <repository-relative-manifest-path> sha256:<64-hex-manifest-digest>` Lore trailer per unique package in supplied order.

When the same handoff also includes a hardening deferral, reference `/use-mulgae` and use only read-only exact-run status and findings queries. Require committed publication, a successful findings query, exact membership of every supplied finding ID in the supplied run, and equality between the native reviewed target digest and the promoted manifest. Reject an unavailable run, mismatched or duplicate finding, uncertain query, or deferral metadata from any caller other than the owning epic-handler.

Never add new `Mulgae-Deferred-Run` or `Mulgae-Deferred-Finding` trailers. Do not copy finding descriptions, recommendations, severities, paths, reports, provider or model identities, runtime identities, or private native artifacts into the commit message. When the handoff explicitly says that no promoted evidence applies, add no `Aquarium-Evidence` trailer.

Before committing in a Sanho-managed repository, reference `/use-sanho` and follow its commit-boundary workflow when available. If unavailable and required, stop and route to `/aquarium:dev-setup`; otherwise use the repository-required check or minimal `sanho status --json` fallback. Sanho status never grants commit authority.

## Commit Through the Gate

Bind the exact identity snapshot values to task-scoped `aquarium_commit_name` and `aquarium_commit_email` variables. Run exactly one direct commit with all author and committer environment overrides removed, all six Git identity keys pinned to the repository identity at command scope, and the hook marker scoped to that process:

```bash
env \
  -u GIT_AUTHOR_NAME \
  -u GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL \
  -u GIT_COMMITTER_NAME \
  -u GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL \
  AQUARIUM_COMMIT_GATE=task-commit-v1 \
  git -c user.name="$aquarium_commit_name" \
      -c user.email="$aquarium_commit_email" \
      -c author.name="$aquarium_commit_name" \
      -c author.email="$aquarium_commit_email" \
      -c committer.name="$aquarium_commit_name" \
      -c committer.email="$aquarium_commit_email" \
      commit ...
```

The explicit `author.*` and `committer.*` pins prevent system, global, local, worktree, or conditional configuration from overriding the repository `user.*` snapshot. Do not pass `--author` or otherwise override the pinned author or committer identity. The marker signals only that this skill completed the checks above. Never export it globally, use it outside this skill, or treat it as authority. Do not amend or push.

After the commit and its hooks, compare the commit with the recorded staged snapshot byte-for-byte. Read `%an%x00%ae%x00%cn%x00%ce` from the new commit and require both author and committer to match the identity snapshot exactly. Do not amend an identity mismatch automatically. Also verify the release-note decision and every expected promoted-evidence trailer and committed manifest/payload digest, inspect staged, unstaged, and untracked state for residue or hook changes, and refresh the applicable Sanho status.

Report the commit ID, task relationship, final roadmap state, release-note target and decision, committed paths, checks and evidence inherited from the owner, evidence trailer state when applicable, remaining worktree state, and publication gap.

The bundled hook is a local guardrail, not complete enforcement: it detects direct shell `git commit` invocations in roadmap repositories, while indirect commits performed by other tools may not pass through that boundary. It is inert until the plugin is trusted.
