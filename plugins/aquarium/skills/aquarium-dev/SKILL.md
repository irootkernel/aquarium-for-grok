# Aquarium Development Channel

Use unreleased local-main artifacts without changing production tool installations. This skill is explicit-only. Read [development-contract.md](references/development-contract.md) before any action.

## Diagnose before effects

1. Resolve this skill directory and run `python3 <skill-directory>/scripts/aquarium_dev.py diagnose --repository <git-root>`.
2. Read the complete JSON result or error. Diagnosis is read-only: do not create `~/.aquarium-dev/`, install a hook or launcher, build, authenticate, configure Grok, or repair anything.
3. Require Darwin on arm64, one regular non-symlink Git root, a supported producer identity, local `main`, both shared Make targets, and native repository-local hooks. Report dirty state separately; a build cannot consume it.
4. If an enrollment exists, compare the canonical checkout, hook ownership, current artifact, and executable command selector. Never discover or switch canonical checkouts implicitly.

## Keep approvals separate

Obtain separate explicit approvals for enrollment metadata, the Aquarium-owned native hook block, the initial or recovery build, and the user-local launcher. Re-enrollment additionally requires approval for the exact checkout transfer or same-checkout migration of one recorded legacy Aquarium block. No approval authorizes authentication, Grok configuration, production installation changes, a Git commit, or a producer-repository change.

Run enrollment only after both enrollment and hook approvals:

```text
python3 <skill-directory>/scripts/aquarium_dev.py enroll \
  --repository <git-root> --approve-enrollment --approve-hook
```

Add `--approve-reenrollment` only for an approved checkout transfer or same-checkout legacy-manager migration. Re-enrollment removes only the exact recorded Aquarium marker block. Missing, duplicate, changed, symbolic, external, or ambiguous hook state fails closed.

Install the explicit launcher only after approval:

```text
python3 <skill-directory>/scripts/aquarium_dev.py install-launcher \
  --approve-launcher
```

The only supported target is `~/.local/bin/aquarium-dev`. The launcher inherits the caller's complete environment, including any existing `CODEX_HOME`, and prepends only `~/.aquarium-dev/bin` to the child `PATH`.

For a foreground `mulgae`, `gaori`, `sanho`, or `dolgorae` producer, it leases and executes the selected immutable development generation when one exists. Otherwise it resolves only that command from the caller's global `PATH`, excluding both Aquarium state roots.

A v2 managed-service producer executes only after its producer-owned controller reports the same active generation as ready or busy. Missing, pending, invalid, mismatched, stopped, or recovering managed-service state fails closed without production fallback. Podway is the first required managed service. The launcher does not inject Podway's `--dev`; the producer's development-safe command entrypoint owns that behavior.

## Build and expose development artifacts

Use `diagnose` again after every effect. Hook repair uses `repair-hook --approve-hook`; a build uses `rebuild --approve-build`. Never edit enrollment JSON, hook markers, `current` selectors, or stable `bin` indirections manually.

The native hook queues one exact completed local-main SHA. The manager builds that commit in an isolated exact checkout and seals the immutable generation. Foreground producers atomically advance `current/<project-id>`. Managed-service builds first advance `pending/<project-id>`; their old command/controller/service pair stays current until an independently approved, token-fenced controller apply succeeds.

Executable consumers use one stable `bin/<project-id>` indirection and generation lease; managed-service consumers additionally hold the shared service-generation lock. Aquarium plugin artifacts remain available under `current/aquarium` for separately authorized consumers but are never installed into any host's plugin home by this workflow.

For a pending managed service, run the read-only plan and show its complete status, action, active and target SHAs, busy state, and exact token:

```text
python3 <skill-directory>/scripts/aquarium_dev.py service-plan \
  --project-id <project-id>
```

Run `service-apply` only after separate approval of that exact plan token:

```text
python3 <skill-directory>/scripts/aquarium_dev.py service-apply \
  --project-id <project-id> --plan-token <exact-token> --approve-service
```

A deferred busy plan has no token and authorizes no apply. Never synthesize a token, bypass the controller, or treat a successful build as service activation.

Run an enrolled executable explicitly:

```text
aquarium-dev <tool> [args...]
```

The frozen v1 producer contract supports one Aquarium Codex plugin artifact plus foreground tool executables at `bin/<project-id>`. The generic v2 `managed-service` contract adds one immutable bundle, development-safe public command, and producer-owned `libexec/aquarium-dev-service` controller.

The controller owns any number of internal daemons and implements strict read-only `status`/`plan` plus exact-token `apply`; Aquarium never edits its LaunchAgent, registry, database, socket, or tool-specific runtime. Each tool repository owns its producer implementation and enrolls its canonical checkout only after its approved handoff commit is created.

Dolgorae remains an optional development producer. The launcher admits it when a selected generation exists or a global `dolgorae` is on PATH; a missing Dolgorae is not fail-closed readiness and is not diagnosed or installed by `/aquarium:dev-setup`. Sanho remains excluded from the required global-binary baseline.

## State boundary

All development-channel state lives under `~/.aquarium-dev`. Aquarium never writes development state beneath `~/.aquarium`, creates a dedicated Codex home, copies credentials, performs login, or changes plugin or MCP configuration. Development artifacts are local integration evidence only; they are not stable installations, release candidates, distribution artifacts, or release-QA substitutes.
