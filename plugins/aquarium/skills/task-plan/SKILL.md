# Task Plan

Plan only one task. Require the repository, canonical roadmap path, and exact task ID established by `/aquarium:task-handler`; when invoked directly, reconstruct and validate those inputs before proceeding.

Read [epic-execution-sot.md](../../references/epic-execution-sot.md).

## Explore Without Mutation

Read applicable repository instructions, the task entry, its parent epic, the handler-resolved execution SOT and any active dossier, `docs/README.md`, every relevant canonical role owner, current architecture, Git state, existing tests, CI and task runners, documentation synchronization rules, and configured development-tool guidance. Resolve those authorities from the canonical roadmap; do not require the user to name document paths.

When invoked directly, perform the shared semantic discovery and return any required consolidation to the owning handler rather than creating a dossier or routing to `docs-setup`.

Do not create a goal, edit files, generate code, run rewriting formatters, stage changes, invoke providers, or alter external state.

## Produce and Approve the Plan

Produce a decision-complete plan containing:

- goal, requirements, non-goals, lifecycle meaning, and task boundaries;
- current architecture observations and affected behavior;
- implementation approach and meaningful tradeoffs;
- requirement-to-verification matrix;
- specifications, architecture, decision, implementation-tip, operations, public-documentation, rollout, and review impact;
- exact repository-native verification commands;
- review finding remediation, affected checks, exact restaging of already staged affected paths, and any provider re-review budget;
- known permission, tool, provider, and environment gaps.

Ask for explicit approval of the plan. Do not treat discussion, partial agreement, or approval of a different action as plan approval. If approval is refused, withheld, or given for a different action, stop, report the exact missing decision, and do not enter implementation.

If the host is in Plan mode, remain there and end with a continuation prompt that explicitly invokes `/aquarium:task-handler` with the same repository, roadmap path, task ID, and handler-selected mode. `plan-only` ends without mutation, while `plan-handoff` prepares the approved handoff rather than implementing it. Return the plan, approval state, inspected authority paths, and unresolved gaps to the orchestrator.
